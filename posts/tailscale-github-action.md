While on co-op at [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), I made a blog post for them that recently got published, about securing deployment and testing for your projects (for example, this blog!) by making GitHub Actions that can hook into your private Tailscale network. This means that you do not have to reveal an SSH port to the world, for example.
